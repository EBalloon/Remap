# Remap

This project will copy all pages from the protected process to another process
You will be able to read/write memory dump the game and so on... without RING0/Windows kernel

I tested it for several hours and no bsod, but it may have that risk.
It is working for 1803 until 21H2

    ### Warnings:
    Before closing the game, restore the process you remapped first, otherwise you will have bsod
